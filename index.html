      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h2>WHAT WE WANT:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Invest in a moonshot for Long Covid – a commitment to invest at least $1B per year over the next 10 years
            into NIH research funding and clinical trials.</li>
          <li>Back the Long COVID Support Act (S. 2560), TREAT Long COVID Act (HR 3258), and Long COVID
            RECOVERY NOW Act (HR 1114).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WHY CALL?</h2>
        <p>For those who are able, calling is a very effective way to put pressure on your representative. It’s a proven
          strategy that shows our power. It requires their staff hours, staff attention, call logging, and callbacks.
        </p>

        <h2>WHO SHOULD I CALL?</h2>
        <p>Find the name and number of your Members of Congress at <a href="https://congress.gov/members/find-your-member">congress.gov/members/find-your-member</a> or call the
          Capitol
          Switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask to be transferred to one of your Members of Congress.</p>

        <h2>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CALL?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A staffer will answer the phone.</li>
          <li>Be brief, respectful, and to the point.</li>
          <li>Be clear about your messaging. Example on the next page!</li>
          <li>If you don’t reach a live human, leave a voice message.</li>
          <li>Take your time, and don’t feel stressed!</li>
          <li>You have a right to call and voice your opinion,
            and it doesn’t have to be perfect.</li>
          <li>Your authentic voice matters.</li>

          NIH funding for Long Covid research has run out, and there’s still no

        <p>A recent commentary in the journal Nature called for a new commitment of at least
          one billion dollars per year for the next ten years for NIH research funding and

        <p>Can I count on Representative/Senator [NAME] to support people suffering with Long Covid?</p>

        <h2 class="secondary-color">IF YOU CAN, ADD A BRIEF PERSONAL STORY – FOR EXAMPLE:</h2>
        <p>I have had Long Covid for X years and X months, and it has completely upended my life.<br>
          I can no longer X [activity], which means that X [outcome].</p>
        <p><span class="example">Example:</span> I can no longer work, and I have lost my home.<br>
          <span class="example">Example:</span> I can no longer drive my children to activities, which has impacted
          their
          quality of life and our family bond.

        <p>Many of us are too weak to leave our beds or homes and can’t work to support our families.

        <p><span class="for-label">[For House Reps]</span> I also ask that Representative [NAME] support the existing
